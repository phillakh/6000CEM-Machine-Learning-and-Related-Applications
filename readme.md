# Adult-Census-Income

## Overview
This goal of this project is to build machine learning models that will predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on [census data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).
The Data set contains information about age, gender, occupation, education, workclass of people from US.
We have created different machine learning models to predict whether a salary of a person is greater than $50K or not.
